        A little bit more about me, I enjoy cooking, gardening, traveling, golfing, fishing, and coffee among other things that I can’t think of right now. My favorite season has easily become summer as I love to be outside and not freeze to death, spring is a close second.

        I started out in college as a biology major but became friends with someone who was a graphic design major. I thought a design degree was more well suited for my creative personality and interests, so I made the switch. </p>

        I’m not sure what my future career holds, hopefully it will be something that allows me to travel and maybe even work remote. I hope to move somewhere south where it’s warm all year round when my lease is up next year so I want to look for work out of state. After a few years of traveling I could also see myself settling down and finding something more longterm that’s involved with marketing / business. For the remainder of my time at MSU I’d like to establish a more complete portfolio and create a presence for myself online for my work.
